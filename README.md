# Sara Blanco Gómez - Academic Website

This is my personal academic website built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), featuring my CV and blog posts.

## Building the Site Locally

1. Install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `quarto render` to build the site
4. Run `quarto preview` to preview locally

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Structure

- `index.qmd` - CV/Home page
- `blog/` - Blog posts and listing page
- `_quarto.yml` - Site configuration
- `styles.css` - Custom styling
