## Introduction

I recently created this website to showcase my CV and share updates about my research and experiences. I chose Quarto because it's a powerful, modern publishing system that makes it easy to create beautiful websites with minimal configuration.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that:

- Supports multiple formats (websites, books, presentations, articles)
- Works seamlessly with Markdown
- Integrates with GitHub Pages for easy deployment
- Provides built-in blog functionality
- Offers beautiful, responsive themes out of the box

## Setting Up the Website

### 1. Installing Quarto

First, I installed Quarto on my development environment:

```bash
wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.6.39/quarto-1.6.39-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.6.39-linux-amd64.deb
```

### 2. Project Structure

I organized my website with the following structure:

```
.
├── _quarto.yml          # Main configuration file
├── index.qmd            # CV/Home page
├── blog/
│   ├── index.qmd        # Blog listing page
│   └── posts/           # Individual blog posts
├── headshot.jpg         # Profile photo
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish.yml  # GitHub Actions deployment
```

### 3. Configuration

The `_quarto.yml` file defines the website structure, navigation, and styling. I configured it to have:

- A home page featuring my CV
- A blog section with automatic post listing
- Navigation bar with links to both sections
- A clean, professional theme (Cosmo)

### 4. Converting My CV

I converted my existing CV from Markdown to Quarto format by:

1. Renaming `index.md` to `index.qmd`
2. Adding YAML front matter with page configuration
3. Keeping all the existing Markdown content

### 5. Setting Up the Blog

The blog functionality in Quarto is straightforward:

- Create a `blog/index.qmd` file with a listing configuration
- Each blog post goes in its own folder under `blog/posts/`
- Posts are automatically sorted by date and displayed on the blog page

### 6. GitHub Actions Deployment

To automatically deploy the site to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes, I created a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Quarto
3. Renders the website
4. Deploys the output to GitHub Pages

## Results

The result is a clean, professional website that:

- Displays my CV prominently on the home page
- Provides a dedicated blog section for updates and articles
- Automatically deploys whenever I push changes to GitHub
- Works perfectly on mobile and desktop devices

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Add more blog posts about my research
- Include project portfolios
- Potentially add interactive visualizations using Quarto's computational notebook features

If you're considering creating your own academic website, I highly recommend Quarto. It's powerful yet simple, and the documentation is excellent!
